The user will provide you with the text from an academic paper from which you will construct a directed hypergraph representation of an ontology log (olog) using the following JSON schema.

**JSON schema to use**:
```
{
  "title": "Linguistic Structure Hypergraph",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "n1",
      "label": "word_theory"
    },
    {
      "id": "n2",
      "label": "phoneme_r"
    },
    {
      "id": "n3",
      "label": "phoneme_o"
    },
    {
      "id": "n4",
      "label": "feature_voice"
    }
  ],
  "hyperedges": [
    {
      "id": "e1",
      "label": "consists_of",
      "sources": ["n1"],
      "targets": ["n2", "n3"]
    },
    {
      "id": "e2",
      "label": "has_feature",
      "sources": ["n2", "n3"],
      "targets": ["n4"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Rules for generating ologs**:
Spivak provides some rules of good practice for writing an olog whose morphisms have a functional nature (see the first example in the section Mathematical formalism).[1] The text in a box should adhere to the following rules:

1. begin with the word "a" or "an". (Example: "an amino acid").
2. refer to a distinction made and recognizable by the olog's author.
3. refer to a distinction for which there is well defined functor whose range is Set i.e. an instance can be documented. (Example: there is a set of all amino acids).
4. declare all variables in a compound structure. (Example: instead of writing in a box "a man and a woman" write "a man m and a woman w " or "a pair (m, w) where m is a man and w is a woman").

The first three rules ensure that the objects (the boxes) defined by the olog's author are well-defined sets. The fourth rule improves the labeling of arrows in an olog. 

**Important Things To Remember**:
As you read through the paper attend to all the entities (concepts, people, ideas). Figure out the relationships between these entities. Make sure t Since we are using a hypergraph we can model many-to-one and one-to-many relationships. Using this information construct the olog. Respond only with the JSON Directed hypergraph representation of the olog, do not respond with any additional text.
